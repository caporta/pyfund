General Notes
=============

- Strings support slicing, because they implement the `sequence` protocol
- Follow the Law of Demeter to reduce coupling
- Comprehensions can be nested
- It can be useful to sometimes discard the current item in a comprehension
- When dealing with one-based collections, it's often easier to just waste a list entry
- Avoid using classes when functions will suffice
- Comprehensions or generator expressions can be split over multiple lines
- Statements can be split over multiple lines using backslashes
  - Use only to improve readability
- "Tell, don't ask."
