Debugging - Summary
===================

- `pdb.set_trace()`
- `python -m pdb <filename>` start program under PDB

- `help [cmd]` => built-in help
- `where`      => show current call stack
- `next`       => execute only the next line
- `continue`   => continue execution until next breakpoint
- `list`       => show source code at current location
- `return`     => resume execution until end of current function
- `print`      => See object values in debugger
- `quit`       => ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
